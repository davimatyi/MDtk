# MDtk

This repository contains the firmware for the MDtk programmable numeric keyboard.\
The board uses an STM32F411CEU6 as it's main controller. The firmware is written in object-oriented C++ using additional Arduino libraries. Upload is done through STM32CubeProgrammer, using the Arduino IDE, or the VS Code Arduino extension.

The pcb design for the board can be found [here](https://github.com/davimatyi/MDtk_pcb)

A companion app is also being developed in [this repository](https://github.com/davimatyi/MDtk_utility)
